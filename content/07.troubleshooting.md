## Troubleshooting: how to help yourself and when to get help

If you have tried the strategies above and are having trouble with your data, it's time to ask for help.
The first point of attack is always to Google the error, including any identifying error message or code, the program name, and if necessary, the type of data you're running.
There are a vast array of online resources for bioinformatic help ranging from question sites such as Stack Overflow and BioStars, to personal or academic blogs or even tutorials and lessons written by experts in the field \cite{parnell2011biostar}.
In most cases, the error you've encountered has been encountered many times before, and often the solution is readily available.
If you can't find any solutions in the relevant search results, it's time to escalate.
If the error is with a specific program, it's best to post on that program's help or issue location (e.g. GitHub Issues), or google group mailing list.
Often the authors of your software will post their preferred location for answering questions and solving errors related to their program.
Be sure to include the relevant details of your error, including terminal output and the version of the software you are using.
 If your error or question is more general, such as asking about program choice or workflows, Stack Overflow is a good choice.
First, search through related topics to ensure your question has not already been answered.
If it hasn't, make a post to a relevant section, and be sure to include all relevant information in your post - type of data you have, approaches you've tried already, relevant error message, etc.

While there is lots of help available online, there's no substitute for local communities where you can get help working with your data and learning to troubleshoot.
Many people around you may be experiencing similar issues and finding it difficult to find appropriate help.
Developing a local bioinformatics community, either via seminar series or meetup sessions for data analysis, can also help in both improving and expanding your work in this area.
Once you establish a local community, it may also be useful to set up a local online sites (e.g. discourse) for group troubleshooting.
While this may seem like just a local version of Stack Overflow, the local, member-only nature can help create a safe and collaborative online space for troubleshooting problems often encountered by your local bioinformatics community.
The benefit to beginners is clear: learning the best way to post questions and the important parts of errors, while getting their questions answered so they can move forward in their research.
However, intermediate users may find these communities most useful, as they can also accelerate their own troubleshooting skills by helping others solve issues that they have already struggled through.
While it can be helpful to have some experts available to help answer questions or to know when to escalate to Stack Overflow or other communities, a collaborative community of practice with members at all experience levels can help all its members move their science forward faster.
