## Troubleshooting: how to help yourself and when to get help

The nature of research software (including workflow system software) is that it is often undergoing its own iterative development process to better address the research question and user needs at hand.
For users, this can be an incredible feature.
Tools under active development are likely to improve software efficiency, add new functions, improve user interaction and documentation, and be responsive to queries.
However, as developers build their software, functionality may change, and despite best efforts, documentation can get out of date [@doi:10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1].
The means that your workflows will undoubtedly require troubleshooting and iteration, often even while running test datasets associated with the software!
On top of this, the challenges of learning and interacting with research software - from the coding languages all the way to workflow systems, require time and patience, and it will be difficult to identify coding errors while you are unfamiliar with the syntax [@doi:10.1139/facets-2019-0020].



One of the largest barriers is learning how, when, and where to ask for help.

As more research software development is happening openly in online repositories such as GitHub...

 ...  carpentries/ etc have been trying to build communities with good code of conduct!

working to foster an active, inclusive, and diverse community for data-intensive biology.

 of learners and instructors that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research

Below we outline a strategy for troubleshooting that can help build your own knowledge while respecting both your own time and that of research software developers and the larger bioinformatic community.







**When adopting a new tool**
--> semantic versioning
Look for a well-defined semantic versioning statement.


If you have tried the strategies above and are having trouble with your workflow, it's time to ask for help.
The first point of attack is always to Google the error, including any identifying error message or code, the program name, and if necessary, the type of data you're running.
There are a vast array of online resources for bioinformatic help ranging from question sites such as Stack Overflow and BioStars, to personal or academic blogs or even tutorials and lessons written by experts in the field [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002216].
In most cases, the error you've encountered has been encountered many times before, and often the solution is readily available.
If you can't find any solutions in the relevant search results, it's time to escalate.
If the error is with a specific program, it's best to post on that program's help or issue location (e.g. GitHub Issues), or google group mailing list.
Often the authors of your software will post their preferred location for answering questions and solving errors related to their program.
Be sure to include the relevant details of your error, including terminal output and the version of the software you are using.
 If your error or question is more general, such as asking about program choice or workflows, Stack Overflow is a good choice.
First, search through related topics to ensure your question has not already been answered.
If it hasn't, make a post to a relevant section, and be sure to include all relevant information in your post - type of data you have, approaches you've tried already, relevant error message, etc.

While there is lots of help available online, there's no substitute for local communities where you can get help working with your data and learning to troubleshoot.
Many people around you may be experiencing similar issues and finding it difficult to find appropriate help.
Developing a local bioinformatics community, either via seminar series or meetup sessions for data analysis, can also help in both improving and expanding your work in this area.
Once you establish a local community, it may also be useful to set up a local online sites (e.g. discourse) for group troubleshooting.
While this may seem like just a local version of Stack Overflow, the local, member-only nature can help create a safe and collaborative online space for troubleshooting problems often encountered by your local bioinformatics community.
The benefit to beginners is clear: learning the best way to post questions and the important parts of errors, while getting their questions answered so they can move forward in their research.
However, intermediate users may find these communities most useful, as they can also accelerate their own troubleshooting skills by helping others solve issues that they have already struggled through.
While it can be helpful to have some experts available to help answer questions or to know when to escalate to Stack Overflow or other communities, a collaborative community of practice with members at all experience levels can help all its members move their science forward faster.


****
intro paragraph (remaining bits to make sure are addressed):
 it is likely that things will need a little troubleshooting to work. link to growth mindset! it is not that you are failing, but that the nature of the beast is to require iteration, troubleshooting, etc
- finally, as you're learning, you'll make mistakes! you won't know how to properly apply things! ^ == growth mindset. this happens to everyone.

**Try to pinpoint your issue or error**

**Include the right details with your question**

**Seek help in all the right places**
**Where to seek help**

Buidling a local community of practice [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2005561]

**When to ask a question/for help ORRR how to troubleshoot?**
- do some troubleshooting first
- google your error message
- run the test data
- try to figure out the exact conditions that produced your error == narrow your question down. This helps others help you, and may sometimes even lead  you to solve the whole thing yourself

**Include the right details with your question**
- once you've done this legwork, if your issue hasn't resolved itself, it's time to reach out.
- when asking for help, it's essential to provide the right details... (which are: software, version, code, etc)
- putting the effort into the bits above shows respect for the community and helpers, and makes it 1. easier/faster for people to solve your issue, 2. increases your own understanding of the issues itself and the program.


-  local communities: many benefits!

- online forums and communities: also can be awesome. here's where to start! (stackoverflow, etc)
