## Author Summary {.page_break_before}

In this paper, we present our guide for workflow-enabled biological sequence data analysis, developed through our own teaching, training and analysis. We recognize that this is currently biased towards our own use cases and experiences, but we hope to engage in robust discussion with the open source community to build a comprehensive resource.
Our main goal is to accelerate scientists conducting sequence analyses into organized workflow practices that benefit their own research while also facilitating open and reproducible science.
