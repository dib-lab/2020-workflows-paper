## Introduction


Sequencing data are now widely available for species across the tree of life, and new sequencing data continues to be generated at a fantastic clip. %(cite sra growth?).
The wealth of information present in sequencing data has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the diversity and function of communities, building basic understanding from ecosystems to human health.
However, sequence analysis remains both complex and computationally intensive, problems that are compounded during analysis of large datasets.

The magnitude of sequencing data requires a principled approach to management, analysis, and dissemination of results.
As sequencing analysis has matured over the past decade, several papers have presented "best" or "good enough" practices for computational biological analyses [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1002303; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510].
These recommendations have both helped build consensus and fueled additional tool and workflow development.
Since the latest paper in 2017 [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510], a number of important tools have greatly reduced the barrier to entry and opened the door to end-to-end reproducible analyses. % simple, shareable, etc
Many of these changes owe their origin, at least in part, to the open science movement and the recognition of the importance of entry-level training, such as that provided by The Carpentries [@doi:10.2218/ijdc.v10i1.351](open sci movement CITE).

The key advancements over the past few years have come in workflow scripting, software management, and tools that handle biological data at scale. % and sharing? Role of github/open code?
The combination of workflow languages (e.g. snakemake, nextflow, common workflow language) and package installations (e.g. conda) have revolutionized bioinformatic analysis development.
These tools enable researchers to build reproducible analyses that can be automatically executed in a directed fashion.
With integrated installations, these workflows can work across different computational systems, and can even serve as a form of documentation for the analysis.
Finally, when paired with new tools leveraging computational approximations, this suite of tools enables researchers to cope with the enormity of sequencing data.
%have emerged a promising solution to coping with the enormity of sequencing data.
%..provide researchers a framework/structure
%Adopting workflow-based systems may be the single best step you can take to improve your analyses (here's where to talk up workflows!)
%bonus: these integrate with software installation! Also provide a bunch of other neat data-sciencey logging and benchmarking.

In this paper, we build on our experiences training researchers as part of The Carpentries and other courses and workshops.
We present a roadmap for biological sequence analysis, beginning at data acquisition and providing specific recommendations for tools that ensure the integrity of your data along the way.
We emphasize the importance of adopting a workflow-based approach to enhance documentation, automation and reproducibility of your science.
Adopting these approaches will not only propel your own research, but will also facilitate sharing, discussion, peer review, etc.
Here, we present our best advice on how to get the most out of your sequencing data and time.
